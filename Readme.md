# Coding Question

#### Q.  Given two arrays that are not sorted, your task is to create a new sorted array by merging these two arrays. The resulting array should not contain any duplicate elements. For instance, if Array A = [3, 1, 5] and Array B = [2, 4, 1], the merged array, after sorting and removing duplicates, would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]."
